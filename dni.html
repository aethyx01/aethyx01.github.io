  <h3 class="title">Do Not Interact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Racists, sexists, zionists, pedophile, zoophile, ableist, proship, anti-yume, homophobic, transphobic, biphobic, acephobic, anti-poly, etc. (non-exhaustive, just don't be an asshole)</li>
      <li>Minors</li>
      <li>Most doubles</li>
      <li>People who post about doubles or tell them Sigma loves only them</li>
      <li>Toxic people (i.e. people who only want to cause drama/jump on drama without proof or hearing out both sides/condone, encourage, or participate in harassment or senseless drama/view selfshipping as a competition/try to start fights between users/hide behind anonymity to be terrible or are just terrible in general/etc.; non-exhaustive)</li>
      <li>People who are weird about Sigma or BSD</li>
      <li>FyoSig shippers</li>
      <li>Fyodor yumes</li>
      <li>People who use she/her for Sigma</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: DNI criteria don't apply if I interact first. Also, I block freely.</p>
  <h3 class="title">Before You Follow</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I get overwhemled very easily and may shut down and go inactive without warning if I get too stressed.</li>
      <li>I suffer from dissociation, which sometimes makes it hard for me to realize that myself or other people are real people. I may act a bit strangely at times (feel free to <emphasis>nicely</emphasis> call me on it) due to this, but I'll never be outright mean or do anything really bad.</li>
      <li>I want to make new friends and allow new yumes space in the community, so I won't do/enforce fidelity unless we're super, super close.<br><strong>The exception is Arcee from Transformers because that's SkyeBug's wife!</strong></li>
      <li>I believe in the multiverse theory of selfshipping, so I believe every yume selfships with a different version of their FO. Therefore, I do not believe that doubles ship with the same Sigma as me and seeing doubles doesn't make me insecure or jealous, but I personally do not like to interact with them for the most part. So please, do not try to involve me with doubles and especially don't pick fights on my behalf. That is an extremely fucking weird thing to do and I do not condone that behavior at all. If I find out you have done this, you will be blocked immediately, no questions asked.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3 class="title">Please Interact!</h3>
